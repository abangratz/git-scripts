#git-scripts

A collection (\*cough\*) of git scripts I use in daily practice.

## git-interactive-branches

Used for deleting merged branches.

### Usage

Default is an interactive mode that shows you a menu where you can select a branch or
multiple branches that have been merged and delete them locally.

The other mode is `git interactive-branches --delete-merged` which deletes **all** merged branches immediately.
